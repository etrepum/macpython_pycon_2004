Do you really care that you are using a Macintosh?


What is MacPython
    Python from CVS on Mac
    Tools equivalent to an Activestate python


MacPython's Past
    Originally for Mac OS Classic

    Guido used to own a Mac
        then Jack Jansen took over
    Uses WASTE for text widgets
        and GUSI to act more like *NIX (from MacPerl)
    Still exists but not as actively maintained
    Some people are still using it

MacPython Now
    Has some rough edges
    Inherits the good stuff from BSD
    Has many new APIs of its own

MacPython Tools
    BuildApplet
        turn scripts into applications
    PackageManger
        install few packages from a central db
    PythonLauncher
        Allows double-clicking of .py files
    PythonIDE
        Old MacOS IDE, unmaintained (written by Just van Rossum)
... all of this are being replaced (to be replaced by Cocoa alternatives)

How do I get it?
    OS X 10.2
        Don't use Apple Python 2.2.0
        Get MacPython-Jaguar 2.3
    OS X 10.3
        Please use Apple Python 2.3.0
        ... and don't install any other Python
           may work if you don't install it (need to set ENV list)
        Adding another Python tends to screw things up
        Also get the MacPython-Addons

MacPython IDEs
     IDEs
        Emacs
        Vim
        SubEthaEdit
        Xcode
            Python syntax highlight but not much else
            Working on Xcode templates to make stuff easy
            Working on Xcode based debugger
        BBEdit
        PythonIDE (via MacPython addons)
            no highlighting
            Unrecommended
            has some debug tools
        PyOXIDE
            Cocoa based IDE
            Code folding and syntax highlighting
            debugger
            very new and alpha, seems to have a future
        X11 Python editors
            WingIDE
            which are ugly...

Darwin
    os.name == "posix" is True
    So it is BSD!

Not quite BSD
    HFS+ Thinks different
        case insensitive filesysetm
        files can have multiple forks
    Inherited from NeXT
        XML property lists
        Bundles and Frameworks
            A documented directory structure, alternative to tarball, acts as a single file in Finder
        dyld is not your average linker
            Just let distutils deal with that
        Tons of new APIs

Forking Files
    Resource forks are Not For POSIX
        POSIX layer doesn't know about Resource Forks.
        You need Carbon to read forks
        Chance are, you will lose.
    
    But you can get at one if you need to:
        file(filename + "../namedfork/rsrc")

Property Lists
    Binary
        deprecated
        object serialization
    Text
        deprecated
        looks sort of like YAML
    XML property list
        preferred
        Dictionary serializationn
    Can use Apple's property list editor
        APIs available 

    plistlib available
        Load a plist, acts like a Python Dictionary
    NSDictionary is another way, using PyObjC

Objective C
    Portable (GNUStep uses it)
    Mostly just C with [some new:syntax]
    Plays nicely with Python using PyObjC
    

Bundles are like packages
    Fixed directory structure
    General purpose
    Localization features baked in
    Most loook like a single file in Finder
    All applications should be bundles
    ... they need to be in order to use the GUI
    Structure
        Bootstrap code in MacOS Folder
        Python code and resources in Resources folder
        Info.plist and metadata

/usr/bin/pythonw
    The way to run GUI scripts
    tricks WindowServer
        pretends to be running from the Python app bundle
    Not useful for Cocoa applications

bundlebuilder
    Standard MacPython module
    Similar in purpose to py2exe or freeze
    Similar in API to distutiles, but not (yet) integrated
    Documented on pythonmac.org wiki
    Something better is coming soon

Other bundles
    Document Bundles
    Code Bundles

Apple Events
    Interapplication communication
    Used primarily for automation tasks
    old and low level
    difficult api
        except from applescript or cocoa
    Looks like English, but isn't!
    Python and AE
        Carbon
        gensuite module
        aeve
            pythonic bridge, dev on hold
        appscript
            closer to applescript, actively developed
        
    a few exammples


Cocoa
    NeXT fwks ported to OSX
    Apps
        ReSTedit - 
            restructured text editor
            live preview
        Zope Edit Manager
        DrawBot (nifty 'cause the drawing stays vector)
        PyInterpreter
            in process interpreter
    You can subclass an Objective C class and pass it back and Objective C doesn't know/care
    Live demo
        (not sure how to describe this...)
        Sets up a Table in a window
        Binds it to an NSArrayController
        Writes a 3-liner to populate the Table with the contents of sys.modules (right?)

Cross-platform Toolkits
    TkInter is buggy
        Messed up colors, etc.
    PyQT is buggy
        Works. Somewhat.
    wxPython is buggy
        uses Carbon widgets
        doesn't use them quite correctly
    why not use Cocoa
    X11 is still ugly
    pygame works!
        pygame Aliens
    pyOpenGL

Community
    pythonmac-sig
        at Python.org
    pythonmac.org
        Very useful Wiki and FAQ
    MacPython channel
        iChat - CMD-G MacPython
        Channel on AIM network
    Various blogs

What's next?
    New Tools
        They'll work
        Written in Cocoa
        Using PyObjC

Q: Cross platform UI?
A: Separate UI from other code, etc. Don't use xplat UI toolkits.

Q: XCode templates when?
A: tomorrow?

Q: Does Apple help you?
A: No, not yet, but someone just joined Apple, so we expect that to change...

Q: Is the MVC the same as in NeXTStep?
A: Yes. Also WebObjects.

Q: documentation for developing GUI stuff for python
A: Objective-C docs/Xcode help/pyobjc

Q: Safari?
A: Built on C++ and Objective C using a Konqueror core. You can use their HTML widget in your code.

Q: Patching bugs in Apple 2.3.0?
A: Under discussion... Working on it.

NOTES ON / KEY TO THIS TEMPLATE:
A headline (like a field in a database) will be CAPITALISED
    This differentiates from the text that follows
A variable that you can change will be surrounded by _underscores_
    Spaces in variables are also replaced with under_scores
    This allows people to select the whole variable with a simple double-click
A tool-tip is lower case and surrounded by {curly brackets / parentheses}
    These supply helpful contextual information.
